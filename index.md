## ANU AI Reading Group

Welcome to the ANU AI reading group. Every week, this reading group will discuss a paper that falls under the general category of artificial intelligence (AI). Some examples of such topics include deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning. 
The reading group is held in the Alan Turing Room, CSIT Building every Friday at 12:30pm.
